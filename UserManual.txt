User manual for setting up working system using code:
1)open Library.java file and in a new file named Library.java paste the entire code.
2)set configuration(location of main method) in Edit configuration as <name>.Library,bcz main method is inside Library class,where name is package name in which this new file is present.
3)Attach mysql-connector-for-java.jar file in external libraries section in intellij ide(project structure->modules->dependencies->+ button->jars or directories->choose path of file location and click ok).
4)Make sure to have database already built inside the machine(i used mysql workbench to create database easily without querying from scratch,whole database is just two tables(student,book)-DDL of 2 tables in DataBase.txt file,i dongt know the exact queries to build whole database automatically but mentioned DDL of 2 tables in txt file)-No foreign key directly in database inbuilt structure(student id column is same in both tables) but inside code i acted like there is one foreign key(sid) by doing appropriate operations and dealing all cases,change url(database name,socket name),username and password inside code appropriately in starting lines.
5)run it,will work(or gives appropriate exceptions and we can know our faults or go through code once).
